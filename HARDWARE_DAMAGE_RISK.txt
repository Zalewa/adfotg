!!! HARDWARE DAMAGE RISK !!!
============================

CUT THE +5V LINE FROM THE USB CABLE!

This line will connect the voltage from the Raspberry Pi and
power up your Gotek and your Amiga, putting it in a strange
half-state when the normal PSU is OFF and preventing Power LED
dimming when PSU is ON and Amiga reboots.

FOR SAFETY MEASURES, CUT THE +5V LINE! I DID IN MINE.
